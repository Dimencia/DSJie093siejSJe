# MordhauCommunityMapInstaller
This application interfaces with a server hosting all approved Community maps, and provides a list for users to pick which maps they would like to download
Maps are downloaded and installed with one click, helping users to avoid confusion finding Mordhau paths to put the maps in

If your Mordhau path cannot be found via registry, you will be prompted to set it by browsing to your Mordhau folder
@D.Mentia on Discord if you have any questions or find any bugs or problems
