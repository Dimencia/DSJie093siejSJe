This adjusts the way we update to ensure we can let you know once our new Mod Manager is complete.  Also includes small fixes to the way things are displayed, particularly to clarify when a map provides multiple gamemodes.  Made map updates more obvious; fixed a connection issue on Windows 7; fixed crashses related to being unable to find the Mordhau path; ensured app always runs even if it fails to find a path
